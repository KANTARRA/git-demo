Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher

Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
